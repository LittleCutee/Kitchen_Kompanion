# Kitchen_Kompanion

For current uploaded "kitchen.py", it is the webpage what we have currently achieved. It will not be the things what we will do in next step. It is just for simple demonstrations. To run this python file, you need to have python on your PC first and install streamlit module. 
command is "pip3 install streamlit" 
then put command "streamlit run kitchen.py"
Now you can access those screens which I showed on zoom meeting.
